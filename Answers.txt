Q1a.

Because Curve25519 is a Monetgomery curves, it means that we can do x-only arithmetic on it. If we have some Q\in E(F_{P^2}) and the function X [theorem 2.1, CURVE25519], then we can represent X(Q)= i/j where i/j is the quotient of Q. Here X(2Q) or X(Q+Q) = x_2/z_2, defined in [appendix B, CURVE25519]. Thus we get our x-only point as:
